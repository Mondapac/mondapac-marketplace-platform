# customers: build notes (speed mode)

The buyer's own data beside the `identity` account. The owner approved the customer plan on
2026-10-17 (all five packages, one PR each); under speed mode there is no separate G1/G2 brief.
This note records what is built and the rules it keeps.

## Package 1: delivery address book (this module's first slice)

- Table `customers.addresses`: one row per address of a customer account (`account_id`, no
  foreign key). Everything the customer typed (recipient first and last name, phone, address
  lines, suburb, region, postcode, delivery notes) is one ciphertext under the account's subject
  key (`customers.address.content`), so destroying the key at account deletion erases every
  address. Only the country, the default flag and the times are clear. At most one default per
  account (partial unique index).
- Routes `customers/me/addresses` (customer sessions only, CSRF on writes, `no-store`): list,
  add, change, remove, and `POST :id/default`. Use cases are `own-resources`; there is no
  permission key and no admin view. The customer comes from the session, never from the body.
- Rules: the first address is the default; removing the default makes the newest remaining one
  the default; `isDefault: false` never clears the default. At most the Market's
  `customers.addressBookLimit` addresses (AU 20). Recipient name and phone are required (delivery
  only, no SMS).
- Market configuration `customers.address`: country, postcode pattern and region list (AU: the
  eight states and territories, four-digit postcode). A Market without the section answers
  `customers.unavailable`.
- No address value reaches a log, an event, an audit row or an error (a refused field gives its
  path and a code only). Writes run serializable (the limit and the one default span rows).

## Next packages

2. Checkout picks an address and copies it onto the order (snapshot); the seller sees ship-to on
   its own orders only. 3. Customer profile API. 4. Marketing consent record in `legal`.
5. Customer account deletion (v1.5).

## Open follow-ups (Hassan, PR #405 review: GO, two low findings)

- Rows under a destroyed account key still count toward the limit and can be promoted to the
  default. Package 5 (account deletion) deletes the account's `customers.addresses` rows with the
  key, which closes this.
- One damaged ciphertext row makes the list answer 500 (`addressFromJson` throws). Later: let
  `open` return a typed failure, skip the row and log only the address id and a code.
