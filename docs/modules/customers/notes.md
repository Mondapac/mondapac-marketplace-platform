# customers: build notes (speed mode)

The buyer's own data beside the `identity` account. The owner approved the customer plan on
2026-10-17 (all five packages, one PR each); under speed mode there is no separate G1/G2 brief.
This note records what is built and the rules it keeps.

## Package 1: delivery address book (this module's first slice)

- Table `customers.addresses`: one row per address of a customer account (`account_id`, no
  foreign key). Everything the customer typed (recipient first and last name, phone, address
  lines, suburb, region, postcode, delivery notes) is one ciphertext under the account's subject
  key (`customers.address.content`), so destroying the key at account deletion erases every
  address. Only the country, the default flag and the times are clear. At most one default per
  account (partial unique index).
- Routes `customers/me/addresses` (customer sessions only, CSRF on writes, `no-store`): list,
  add, change, remove, and `POST :id/default`. Use cases are `own-resources`; there is no
  permission key and no admin view. The customer comes from the session, never from the body.
- Rules: the first address is the default; removing the default makes the newest remaining one
  the default; `isDefault: false` never clears the default. At most the Market's
  `customers.addressBookLimit` addresses (AU 20). Recipient name and phone are required (delivery
  only, no SMS).
- Market configuration `customers.address`: country, postcode pattern and region list (AU: the
  eight states and territories, four-digit postcode). A Market without the section answers
  `customers.unavailable`.
- No address value reaches a log, an event, an audit row or an error (a refused field gives its
  path and a code only). Writes run serializable (the limit and the one default span rows).

## Package 2: the address at checkout and on the order

- `POST /orders/checkout` takes `{ "addressId": "<uuid>" }`, one of the customer's own
  addresses. Ordering reads it through `CUSTOMERS_CHECKOUT_FACADE` (use case
  `customers.read-delivery-address`, `own-resources`) before the cart or the stock is touched:
  missing is `validation.failed` (400), another customer's, unknown or erased is
  `ordering.address-not-found` (422). Stripe Checkout still collects no address.
- The order keeps a fixed copy in `ordering.orders.ship_to_ciphertext`: the address and its
  country as one ciphertext under the customer account's subject key (`ordering.order.ship-to`),
  written once at insert. A later change or removal in the address book never touches it;
  destroying the key at account deletion erases it while the order's money stays.
- Who sees it: the customer on `GET /orders/:id` and the seller on its own seller order page
  (view, ship, deliver), as `shipTo` (recipient name, phone, address lines, suburb, region,
  postcode, delivery notes, country), never the customer's email or account id. Lists and the
  admin order page carry no address. `shipTo` is null on orders placed before this package and
  once the account was erased.
- Hassan (PR #406 review: GO) follow-ups: (1) a seller can read the address of every paid order
  for ever; later drop `shipTo` from the seller's answer a Market-set time after delivery.
  (2) Removing an address from the book does not remove its copy on placed orders; only account
  erasure (package 5) does. The privacy notice must say so.

## Next packages

3. Customer profile API. 4. Marketing consent record in `legal`.
5. Customer account deletion (v1.5, CUS-03), built in three PRs: 5a (below, built), 5b and 5c.

## Package 5a: account deletion setting and server lock (API only)

Owner approved design v2 on 2026-10-26. Package 5a is the setting and the lock only. There is no
admin screen and no buyer screen yet (screens wait for Reza's review), no deletion flow and no
manual admin deletion.

- **Setting.** One row per Market version in `customers.account_deletion_settings` (insert-only,
  the application role has SELECT and INSERT only, like `assistant.settings`): `enabled`
  (built-in default false) and `waitingPeriodDays` (default 30, allowed 7 to 90). Version 0 is the
  built-in defaults. Each row also keeps the admin account, the time and the `reason`.
- **Admin routes** (population `admin`, `no-store`): `GET` and `PUT
  customers/admin/account-deletion-settings`. View needs `customers.account-deletion-settings.view`
  (plain, in the Viewer default role, seed version 15). Change needs
  `customers.account-deletion-settings.manage`, a protected key held by the Platform Administrator
  only. The body is `{ expectedVersion, settings: { enabled, waitingPeriodDays }, reason }`; CSRF
  as every unsafe route; `reason` is 1 to 500 characters of one line of plain text; a stale
  `expectedVersion` answers `customers.conflict` (409); the same values again change nothing.
- **Audit and event.** A change writes the history row (with the reason), an audit row
  `customers.account-deletion-settings.changed` (versions, `enabled`, `waitingPeriodDays`; audit
  fields hold no free text, so the reason is only in the history row, which is part of the audit
  evidence) and the outbox event `customers.account-deletion-settings-changed.v1` (previous and
  new `enabled` and `waitingPeriodDays`; no actor, because events carry none (ADR-0018 decision
  4), and no reason text), in one unit. `customers` gets its own `customers.outbox` table for it.
- **Admin step-up** (owner decision, after PR #515). A change also needs a fresh two-step
  proof of the admin's session for the admin step-up action
  `customers.account-deletion-settings.change` (`POST identity/admin/step-up/verify`, valid 5
  minutes), exactly as the wallet switch (`wallet.settings.change`): `@RequiresStepUp` on the
  `PUT` route refuses without one with `403 second-factor.required` and `details.actionKey`
  (`second-factor.enrolment-required` when the admin has no active two-step), and the flow spends
  the proof in the unit of the change, so one proof serves one change and a refusal commits
  nothing. A no-op, an invalid body or a stale version spends no proof. The audit row's `after`
  names the proof (`stepUpSessionId`, `stepUpVerifiedAt`). An acting-as session is refused. The
  `GET` needs no proof.
- **Customer route.** `GET customers/me/account-deletion` (customer sessions only, `no-store`)
  answers `{ canDeleteAccount, waitingPeriodDays }`. The buyer UI reads only this.
- **Server lock.** `assertAccountDeletionAllowed(settings, market)` in
  `application/account-deletion-settings-flow.ts` fails with `customers.account-deletion-disabled`
  (HTTP 403 in `CUSTOMERS_STATUS`) while the Market has deletion off, else answers the waiting
  period in force. Package 5b calls it first, inside its own unit of work, and only to start a
  request.

### What packages 5b and 5c will do

- **5b, buyer flow.** The buyer asks to delete their account. Blockers are checked first
  (including a wallet balance above 0). Then an OTP, then
  the waiting period (30 days by default); signing in during the wait cancels the request. At the
  end the account's subject key is destroyed, `engagement` forgets the account
  (`forgetAccount`), and the buyer's reviews are anonymised. A request already pending continues
  if the setting is switched off afterwards: the switch stops only new requests.
- **5c, admin manual deletion.** An admin deletes a buyer's account with a ticket reference, a
  reason and an OTP, under a new `buyers.account.delete` permission, with the same blockers and
  the same waiting period.

## Open follow-ups (Hassan, PR #405 review: GO, two low findings)

- Rows under a destroyed account key still count toward the limit and can be promoted to the
  default. Package 5 (account deletion) deletes the account's `customers.addresses` rows with the
  key, which closes this.
- One damaged ciphertext row makes the list answer 500 (`addressFromJson` throws). Later: let
  `open` return a typed failure, skip the row and log only the address id and a code.
