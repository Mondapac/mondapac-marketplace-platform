# Search: product search (speed mode, Phase 6 package 2)

PostgreSQL full-text search only (ADR-0004 decision 1); Elasticsearch needs a new ADR.

- **Read model:** `search.offer_documents`, one row per sellable (published and listed) Offer per
  Market: offer, product and seller ids, name and short text of the product's published revision in
  the Market's default locale, platform category ids, `search_vector`, `indexed_at`. The vector is
  built by a trigger from name (weight A) and short text (B) with the row's `text_search_config`; a
  GIN index serves the text query, another the category filter. No certification claim is indexed or
  returned: badges come from `evaluateClaim` only (CERT rules); results carry ids, text and categories.
- **Market settings:** `search.textSearchConfig` in `config/markets/<CODE>.json` (AU `english`, the ZZ
  fixture `simple`; a closed list of built-in configurations; absent = `simple`). The locale is the
  Market's `defaultLocale`; an Offer with no text in it is not indexed. Never a default Market.
- **Freshness:** subscriptions to `catalog.offer-published`, `offer-deleted`, `offer-moved` and
  `product-revision-published` call `search.sync-offer-documents` (system). It re-reads catalog through
  `CatalogIndexFacade` (`offerSearchFacts`, `publishedOfferIds`; system only) and upserts or deletes, so
  repeated and out-of-order deliveries converge (no inbox needed). The job `search.rebuild-index` runs
  at worker start and every six hours: it backfills all published Offers and deletes documents it did
  not touch. Run it after changing `textSearchConfig`.
- **Query:** `GET /search/products?q=&category=&page=&pageSize=` (anonymous, Market from `x-market-id`
  like other storefront routes, default rate-limit class per origin, `no-store`). `q` 2 to 100
  characters in web-search syntax (`websearch_to_tsquery`, ranked by `ts_rank`, ties by Offer id, so
  pages are stable); no `q` with `category` browses by name; `pageSize` 1 to 48 (24), `page` 1 to 100;
  unknown parameters are 400. Answer: `{ items, page, pageSize, hasMore }`; `hasMore` is true only when the next result is visible, so hidden matches never show through it.
- **Visibility:** each page is re-checked against catalog (`offerSellUnits`: published and listed) and
  sellers (`sellingEligibility`, the may-sell contract). A failed check is 503 `search.unavailable`,
  never an unchecked list. A page can hold fewer than `pageSize` items, and `hasMore` can be false while a later page still has items.
- **SQL:** the two statements are on the ADR-0030 list (`search.offer-search`, `search.offer-browse`),
  (text, text in one category, browse), all values bound; ADR-0030 was amended for
  `websearch_to_tsquery`, `ts_rank`, `@@`, `@>`, `regconfig`, each in one exact shape.
- **Known gaps:** sellers has no separate "show publicly" read, so may-sell is the test. An off-sale
  cause that raises no event (for example a suspended tag) is hidden at query time and repaired by the
  next rebuild. A write racing a delete can briefly resurrect a document; the query-time check hides it.
  A deep, mostly hidden result set can return short pages. Variants, price, stock, ratings and
  certification badges are not part of this package.
- **Follow-ups (Hassan L-3):** a dedicated rate-limit class for this anonymous route (it uses `default`
  now), and a cap on the number of OR terms in `q`.

## Storefront shelves (storefront reads package, 18 Oct 2026)

- **Routes:** `GET /search/bestsellers?category=&limit=` and `GET /search/specials?category=&limit=`
  (anonymous, `@RoutePopulation('customer')`, default rate-limit class, `no-store`). `limit` 1 to 24
  (storefront's `MAX_SHELF_PRODUCTS`, default 12); `category` is a platform category id; unknown
  parameters are 400.
- **Best sellers:** ordering's `OrderingRankingFacade.bestSellingOffers` (rule anonymous) ranks Offers
  by order lines on orders confirmed in the last 30 days (ids only, no count leaves ordering); search
  takes the top 100, keeps the indexed ones (in the category when asked) in rank order, and fills a
  short shelf from browse order (the category's `search.offer-browse`, else the Market by name).
- **Specials:** pricing's `PricingSpecialsFacade.specialsInForce` (rule anonymous) answers the (Offer,
  Variant) keys whose effective price is a special at its Clock's now, newest first, with the regular
  price in force; an Offer appears once. Items add `variantId`, `price`, `regularPrice` (Money as
  `{ amount: string, currency }`), `taxInclusive` and `specialEndsAt`. Never Cost.
- **Visibility:** the same re-check as the search route (catalog published and listed, seller may
  sell); a failed source or check is 503 `search.unavailable`. No badge, no stock filter (as search).
- **Known gaps:** the Market-wide fill reads `offer_documents` ordered by name without an index on
  `(market_id, name)`; add one if the read model grows large.
