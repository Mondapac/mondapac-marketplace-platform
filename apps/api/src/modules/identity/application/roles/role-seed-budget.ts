/**
 * The byte budget of one seeded role's keys (identity design 5.6; slice 8a-1, Ali's ruling on
 * Mohammad's review of the key length). One `identity.role.seed-applied` row lists the keys an
 * upgrade adds and the keys it removes in one `after`, which must stay within the audit writer's
 * `MAX_AUDIT_SIDE_BYTES` (PA W4). Keys may be up to `MAX_PERMISSION_KEY_LENGTH` (128, the stored
 * column's CHECK) characters, so a count cap alone does not bound the row; this budget does:
 *
 * - `overhead` is measured, not assumed: the canonical JSON of a row with both lists empty and
 *   the largest `seedVersion` the column holds (2_147_483_647), through the writer's own
 *   encoding (`encodeAuditFields`, `canonicalJson`);
 * - each list gets half of what is left: `budget = floor((MAX_AUDIT_SIDE_BYTES - overhead) / 2)`;
 * - a role's cost is the sum of (key length + 3) over its keys: the key, its two quotes and one
 *   comma (keys are ASCII by their pattern, so a character is a byte). This over-counts each
 *   list by one comma.
 *
 * `checkRoleSeed` and `checkRoleSeedKeys` refuse a role over the budget (`keys-too-large`), at
 * boot and on every seed run, besides the separate 40-key cap. Why it holds for every upgrade:
 * "added" is a subset of the new version's keys, which passed the budget; "removed" is a subset
 * of a previous version's keys, which passed the same budget when it shipped. If this formula
 * ever changes, every older entry of test/contracts/role-seed.snapshot.json must be re-checked
 * against the new one, since a Market that is behind can still upgrade from it.
