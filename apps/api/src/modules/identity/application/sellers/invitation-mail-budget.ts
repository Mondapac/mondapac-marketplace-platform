 * mail" (Hassan M1 on PR #204). Runs in the caller's open unit, the one that issues or re-issues
 * the invitation: a refused request answers `err`, which commits nothing, so a counter at its
 * limit stays at it and keeps refusing until its window or block ends; a counted request commits
 * with the invitation.
