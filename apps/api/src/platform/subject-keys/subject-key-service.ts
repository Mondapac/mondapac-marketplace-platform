/**
 * One data key per subject (platform-foundations design 4; ADR-0009 decisions 6 and 8): a
 * person's personal fields become unreadable for ever when their key is destroyed, while
 * history and hash chains stay intact.
 *
 * Guarantees, whatever the adapter (PF 4):
 * 1. One data key per subject for life, generated inside the service and stored only wrapped
 *    under the Region Stack's wrapping key. No operation returns a key; key material and
 *    plaintext never reach logs, errors, events or audit rows.
 * 2. Encryption is authenticated, randomised and bound to the Market, the subject and the
 *    field: a value copied elsewhere does not decrypt. Ciphertext is never compared, indexed
 *    or unique.
 * 3. Labels and purposes are constants of the owning module (`fieldLabel`, `hashPurpose`).
 * 4. `hmac` uses a key derived from the data key and separated by purpose; it cannot back an
 *    equality search across subjects.
 * 5. `createKey` throws `SubjectKeyExistsError` if the subject ever had a key; `destroyKey`
 *    keeps a tombstone and is idempotent.
 * 6. After destruction the data operations answer `subject-key.destroyed`; a subject that never
 *    had a key is a programmer error and throws `SubjectKeyMissingError`.
 * 7. A failure is never an erasure: an unwrap failure or a failed authentication tag throws,
 *    and encryption never falls back to plaintext.
 * 8. `createKey` and `destroyKey` write in the caller's open read-write unit; the data
 *    operations read the key row through the open unit when there is one (so registration
 *    reads its own uncommitted key), otherwise in a read-only unit of their own.
 * 9. No cache of unwrapped keys: one unwrap per operation.
 *
 * Repositories and this service take the `MarketContext` only (foundations 5.2 rule 2).
