 * and never inside the caller's, and caches nothing: the account is active; the population
 * matches the scope of the rule's keys; for the seller population the membership is active,
 * the seller is not suspended, and `pending` or `rejected` is a denial unless the declaration
 * says `allow`; every key is held through the actor's role and known to the registry.
 *
 * It takes the whole declaration, not only the rule (a change to the signature of foundations
 * 6.3), because the seller-state attribute is part of what it decides.
