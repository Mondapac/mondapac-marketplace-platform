 * Writes one audit row into `platform.audit_log`, inside the caller's open read-write unit
 * (docs/design/domain/platform-audit.md 3.1, W1 to W6; ADR-0004 decision 7). Bound per module:
 * a module reaches only its own writer, through its `AUDIT_WRITER` token, and may record only
 * the actions of its own catalogue entries.
 *
 * - W1: it uses `tx(context.market)` and never opens a unit. It refuses when no unit is open,
 *   when the unit is read-only, or when the context's Market is not the unit's.
 * - W2: the actor comes from the context (`authenticated` is `USER` with the account id,
 *   `system` is `SYSTEM`, `anonymous` is `ANONYMOUS`); the caller supplies no actor column.
 * - W3: the id (UUIDv7), Market, tenant and correlation id come from the context and the
 *   platform; `occurred_at` is `Clock.now()` read here, in whole milliseconds.
 * - W4, W4a: the entry must match its sealed catalogue definition exactly (actors, target,
 *   fields, list maxima, at most {@link MAX_AUDIT_SIDE_BYTES} of canonical JSON per side, known
 *   permission keys); an `ANONYMOUS` row names its `boundSubjectId`.
 * - W5: every refusal throws {@link AuditWriteRefusedError}, so the unit rolls back.
 * - W6: one call per audited action; several per use case are fine.
