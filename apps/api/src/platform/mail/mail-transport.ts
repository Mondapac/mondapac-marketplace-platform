/**
 * The mail transport of identity design 9 (decided by Ali, 14.1-5): a port and its adapters

 * no locale and no business rule. `sellers` will use the same port before `notifications`
 * exists (Phase 6).
 *
 * A message holds personal data (the address) and, for a link mail, a one-time token in its
 * body. Neither is ever logged, put in an error or an event: an adapter's error carries a
 * fixed code only (platform persistence 12.3; identity design 6.6, AC 12).
